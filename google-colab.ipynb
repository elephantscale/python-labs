    "\n",
    "## About\n",
    "\n",
    "Google Colaboratory is a full-hosted and free service provided by Google which allows you to load and run notebooks for data science, machine \n",
    "learning, and deep learning.  It has all the normal packages installed and ready to go.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within our labs, you have a choice between installing and running your own python environment, or to run in the hosted Colabs format.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1: Download labs bundle\n",
    "\n",
    "Download the labs bundle from the link given you for there. It will normally be in a `.zip` format. Unpack the zip file to somewhere convenient, \n",
    "such as your desktop. Note that on the MS Windows operating system, simply double clickong on the zip file will *not* extract it.  Instead, you\n",
    "*must* right click on the `.zip` archive and then say **Extract here.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2: Access Google Colaboratory\n",
    "\n",
    "Open the following url:\n",
    "\n",
    "[https://colab.research.google.com/](https://colab.research.google.com/)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 3 : Watch the Intro Video\n",
    "On Collab site, watch the 'Welcome to Colab' video.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## Step 4: Click on the upload link\n",
    "\n",
    "Click on the upload link, as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/google-colab-2.png\" style=\"max-width:100%;border-width:3px;  border-style: solid;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "You will then see the following screen. Select \"Choose File\".\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/google-colab-3.png\" style=\"max-width:100%;border-width:3px;  border-style: solid;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 5: Navigate to your file.\n",
    "\n",
    "- At this point Chrome will bring up a file requester which is unique to your OS: Finder (For Mac), Windows Explorer (for Windows), etc.\n",
    "- Navigate to your saved location (for example, your desktop, and then select the downloaded and and extracted lab folder from your `.zip` file (**NOT** the `.zip` file itself).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with a simple notebook :  __`testing-123.ipynb`__\n",
    "\n",

    "## Step 6: Examine the Loaded Notebook and Run it\n",
    "Inspect the `testing-123` notebook we just loaded.\n",
    "\n",
    "Click on __`Runtime --> Run All`__ to run all the cells\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/google-colab-5.png\" style=\"max-width:100%;border-width:3px;  border-style: solid;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Inspect the output and make sure there are no errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 7: Open a new cell and write some of your own code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us write some of our own code!  Go ahead nd click on the button on top that says `+ CODE`.  It is as shown\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(\"Hello again, world!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can again run your code with Shift and Enter, or with pressing the play button as we saw before\n",
