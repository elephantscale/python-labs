Lab: Docker
==================

In this app, we will create a Python app using Flask and deploy it using docker.


Here is the Dockerfile we are going to use

```Dockerfile
# The base image
FROM ubuntu:latest

# Install python and pip
RUN apt-get update -y
RUN apt-get install -y python-pip python-dev build-essential

# Install Python modules needed by the Python app
COPY requirements.txt /usr/src/app/
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r /usr/src/app/requirements.txt

# Copy files required for the app to run
COPY app.py /usr/src/app/

# Declare the port number the container should expose
EXPOSE 5000

# Run the application
CMD ["python", "/usr/src/app/app.py"]
```

Note what we're going to do.  We are going to start with Ubuntu.

```bash
# You might have to install Docker
sudo snap install docker
sudo snap start docker
```

```bash
cd myfirstapp
docker build -t myfirstapp .
```

You will get a very long output, which will be Docker loading all of your
Dockerfile commands onto your container.

You should look at your Dockerfile

```console

```

I've snipped this for clarity, but pay attention to what's going on.


## List your containers

```bash
docker ls
```

```console
REPOSITORY                                                   TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED                  SIZE
myfirstapp                                                   latest              b2959a4bbf48        Less than a second ago   462MB
ubuntu                                                       latest              452a96d81c30        3 weeks ago              79.6MB
```

Notice myfirstapp is fairly large (462MB). This is because we have a full-on ubuntu system here.  We may not  need that.

## Run the container

```bash
docker container run -p 5000:5000  --name myfirstapp myfirstapp
```

This will run our app.  console output should look like the following

```console
* Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
172.17.0.1 - - [24/May/2018 15:55:11] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 -
172.17.0.1 - - [24/May/2018 15:55:13] "GET /favicon.ico HTTP/1.1" 404 -
```

## Go to browser

Open your browser and go to YOURMACHINE:5000.  If you are running on localhost, then go to localhost:5000

You should see something like the following in your browser:

```console
Hello! This is my Flask app.
```

This indicates your Flask app is running properly. You can now close your container by typing control-c
